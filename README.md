[00:13.43] Got a three day weekend and everybody's loadin' it up
[00:20.00] With my RayBans on and a Yeti in the back of the truck
[00:26.19] I'm ridin' shotgun, playin' DJ
[00:29.51] Mixin' Willie and Hank with some Ying Yang
[00:32.36] Got the windows down and the speakers turned all the way up
[00:38.25] Yeah, we like, oh
[00:39.91] We ain't gotta take it too far from home
[00:42.97] Little bit of Heaven's just down the road
[00:45.86] Where we can lay back, open up a cold one
[00:49.16] Take it slow
[00:50.65] I like piña coladas down in PCB
[00:56.54] Give me that whiskey and cola 'neath that old pine tree
[01:02.72] Ain't nothin' wrong with that white sand and some ocean breeze
[01:09.01] Right now, this lake front view is paradise to me
[01:15.28] Paradise to me
[01:28.17] We got a boat tied up like an island, just killin' the time
[01:34.23] Ain't no tiki huts, but we sippin' on Corona and lime
[01:40.38] We trade a palm tree for them pontoons
[01:43.64] Ridin' waves with the wake boards and Seados
[01:46.69] 'Cause when the sun goes down
[01:48.58] Yeah, we gonna keep it goin' all night
[01:51.22] You know that's right
[01:52.91] Yeah, we like, oh
[01:54.01] We ain't gotta take it too far from home
[01:57.13] Little bit of Heaven's just down the road
[02:00.37] Where we can lay back, open up a cold one
[02:03.46] Take it slow
[02:04.84] I like piña coladas down in PCB
[02:10.76] Give me that whiskey and cola 'neath that old pine tree
[02:16.86] Ain't nothin' wrong with that white sand and some ocean breeze
[02:23.12] Right now, this lake front view is paradise to me
[02:29.33] Paradise to me
[02:35.56] Paradise to me
[02:42.01] When that nine-to-five gets you down
[02:45.68] And you're lookin' for a getaway
[02:49.71] Well, I know just the place
[02:52.91] (Right down the road)
[02:54.76] I like piña coladas down in PCB (PCB, baby)
[03:00.17] Give me that whiskey and cola 'neath that old pine tree (yeah)
[03:07.03] Ain't nothin' wrong with that white sand
[03:10.24] And some ocean breeze (ain't nothin' wrong)
[03:12.97] Right now, this lake front view is paradise to me
[03:19.07] Paradise to me
[03:20.13] Oh, we ain't gotta take it too far from home
[03:25.54] Paradise to me
[03:26.57] Oh, little bit of heaven's just down the road
[03:31.45] Paradise to me
